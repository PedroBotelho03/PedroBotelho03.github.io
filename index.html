        <p>Hello World! My name is Pedro Botelho, and I'm a young professional in the IT industry based in Portugal.</p>
        <p>This is my portfolio, where I get to share some projects I've worked and put all my effort on throughout the years. 
            This website was made by myself :D so, you can count this portofolio, as a web development project as well!</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my work, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me. 
            Click on one of the header topics to either see my CV and know a little bit more about me, or dive right into my projects page.</p>
