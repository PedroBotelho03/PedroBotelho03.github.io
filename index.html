        <p>Hello World! My name is Pedro Botelho and I'm a young guy in the IT industry.</p>
        <p>This is my portfolio, where I get to share some projects I've worked and put all my effort on throughout the years. 
            This website was made by me :D so, even this portfolio itself counts as a web development project. 
            Click on one of the header topics to either see my CV, or dive into my projects.</p>
